# Emoji-Prediction-Project
In this project we create a python program which can predict emoji's from any given sentence using RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) and basic concepts of NLP.
# Goal
- The main goal of this project is to understand the concepts of RNN's and also to get a basic understanding of NLP(Natural Language Processing).
- No need to worry if you're not familiar with these technoligies as the code has been explained inside with the use of comments.
